/*These are the requirements:

The wallet has one owner
The wallet should be able to receive funds, no matter what
It is possible for the owner to spend funds on any kind of address, no matter if its a so-called Externally Owned Account (EOA - with a private key), or a Contract Address.
It should be possible to allow certain people to spend up to a certain amount of funds.
It should be possible to set the owner to a different address by a minimum of 3 out of 5 guardians, in case funds are lost.
